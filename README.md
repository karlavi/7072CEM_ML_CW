My analysis aims to identify the most preferable pre-processing technique and apply various ML models for the prediction of heart disease. In here, I've compared the efficacy of two distinct preprocessing techniques: label encoding and one-hot encoding methods in handling categorical variables within the dataset. For the implementation I have used K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and (NB).
